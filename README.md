# COMP445_A1
HTTP client library implementation

To run using commandline arguments:
1. `cd path/to/COMP445_A1/httpc`
2. `python httpc.py get -v https://httpbin.org/status/418`  
NOTE: if `python` doesn't work, try `python3`

All arguments in [#2] have been implemented.  
Edit `HttpcClient.py` to use the arguments from the commandline for the post request.   
Also keep in mind that commandline httpc isn't an executable yet, that is coming soon
